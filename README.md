# BattleBlobs
Battle Blobs is a fast-paced survival game that allows players to set traps and attack their opponents, developing their strategic thinking and memorization skills. The objective of the game is to outwit the other players and survive the longest. Battle Blobs is a 2D game which employs a top-down perspective, so players can view all the action from above. Each game will be limited to four players, with only one game running at a time. Features include the ability to sign up, login, choose a character, join a game with three other players, chat with other players, and carry out game actions using keyboard controls such as the arrow keys and space bar. During gameplay, users will be able to attack their opponents using traps and specialized weapons, depending on the character chosen. The game ends once the timer is up, and players will be able to see their respective rankings before deciding to play again or quit.
